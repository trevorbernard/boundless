# Mining Walkthrough

::::steps

## Enable ZK mining within Bento

Please see [Enabling ZK Mining](/zkc/mining/enable). 

## Start Proving

Provers are now ready to run proving workloads with ZK mining enabled; this can be done by [running a prover](/provers/quick-start) on the Boundless marketplace or elsewhere.

For each proving job, R0VM will automatically generate work proofs. These work proofs track the total amount of proving work done (in cycles). *Each epoch*, provers will need to submit their accumulated work to the PoVW accounting smart contract. If provers DO NOT submit work each epoch, they will not receive any rewards for that epoch. 

To do this, provers must use the Boundless PoVW CLI and run the following three commands, `prepare`, `submit` and `claim`.

## Create and Update the State File

Once provers have run some jobs, they can create a new "state" file from work proofs stored in Bento using `prepare`:

```bash
boundless povw prepare --new ${REWARD_ADDRESS} --state ${STATE_FILE_LOCATION} --from-bento
```

where `${STATE_FILE_LOCATION}` is something like: `~/folder/state.bin`. 

`prepare` aggregates all work proofs and stores the combined proof to the state file. This process is entirely local (i.e. it does not send any transaction). This state file keeps track of all work done so far for one reward address. Each reward address should have *exactly* one state file associated with it. 

:::warning
Please note that this state file is *very important* and it should be kept in a durable location. Loss of this state file *will result* in the loss of all work that is not submitted** for the respective rewards address, meaning rewards for any work done since the last `submit` **will be lost**. In this scenario, a new rewards address must be specified for Bento, and Bento should be restarted to allow further work to be recorded properly against the new rewards address. *To avoid this scenario, it is recommended to store the state file in a durable location.*

:::

Provers only specify the `--new ${REWARD_ADDRESS}` flag once, this is necessary to create the state file for that specific rewards address. Once the state file is created, provers can run `prepare` and use the state file like so:

```bash
boundless povw prepare --state ${STATE_FILE_LOCATION} --from-bento
```

## Submit the aggregated work proof onchain

After running `prepare`, provers are ready to submit onchain with:

```bash
boundless povw submit --state ${STATE_FILE_LOCATION} --rpc-url ${RPC_URL}
```
